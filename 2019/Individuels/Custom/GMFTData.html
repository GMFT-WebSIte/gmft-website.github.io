    For this tournament, HEAD REFEREES are:
    <ul>
        <strong>
        <li>To be defined</li>
        <li>To be defined</li>
        <li>To be defined</li>
        </strong>
    Thanks to them !
    </ul>
IMPORTANT NOTE TO ALL PLAYERS<br>
The guide to the conduct of player refereeing is based primarily on the fairness in the number of matches refereed by each player.<br>As a result, in the event of a barrage, the players eliminated at the end of the group stage who do not referee in the play-offs, must wait to know if they will referee the next phase before they can leave the competition.
